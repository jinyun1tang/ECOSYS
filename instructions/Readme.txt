The txt files show the parameters ecosys takes in for simulations.

Runfile is the main file where all parameter files are aggregated, the command to run the simulation is:

ecosys.x < runfile where ecosys.x is the executable created after compiling

!! When creating a parameter file the lines where the parameters are located should be respected and separated by commas !! 

If file data is not available, type NO

The types are floats by default, therefore unless explicitly specified, they should be floating point numbers 

output files are files where the outputs will be written to. Needs to be specified YES/NO for each respective output property
