Koppen climate zone,salt,erosion options, grid cells connections, depth of natural water table, depth of artificial water table, slope of natural water table relative to landscape surface

N E S W boundary conditions for surface runoff, N,E,S,W bound condns for subsurf flow, N,E,S,W distance to water table (m), lower boundary conditions for water flow

width of each W-E landscape column

width of each N-S landscape row






water table flag:
0=none:
1,2=natural stationary,mobile:
3,4=artificial stationary,mobile

grid cells:
	   1:2d Transect as rows
	   2:2D transect as cols
	   3:no connections
	   
erosion options:
       :=0 means allowing  freeze- thaw to change elevation
       :=1 means allowing freeze-thaw plus erosion to change elevation
       :=2 means allowing freeze-thaw plus SOC accumulation to change elevation
       :=3 means allowing freeze-thaw plus SOC accumulation, plus erosion to change elevation
       :=-1 means no change in elevation.
